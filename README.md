//Challenge 1: student Grade

//The studentGradeGenerator function takes user input for student marks and checks whether it is within the range of 0 and 100. If it is not within the range, the function returns "Invalid marks entered!". If the input is within the range, it checks the marks against a set of conditions to determine the grade. The grade is then returned as output.

//Challenge 2: Speed Detector

//The speedDetector function takes user input for the speed of a car in kilometers per hour (km/h). If the speed is less than 70 km/h, the function returns "Ok". If the speed is greater than or equal to 70 km/h, the function calculates the number of demerit points to be assigned to the driver. For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), one demerit point is assigned. If the total number of demerit points exceeds 12, the function returns "License suspended". Otherwise, it returns the total number of demerit points.

//Challenge 3: Net Salary 

//The netSalaryCalculator function takes user input for the basic salary and benefits of an individual. It then computes the gross salary by adding the basic salary and benefits. The function then calculates the following deductions from the gross salary: payee (tax), NHIF deductions, and NSSF deductions. The KRA, NHIF, and NSSF rates used in the computation are based on the values provided in the links in the problem statement. Finally, the function returns the computed payee, NHIF deductions, gross salary, and net salary which is the gross salary minus the sum of the payee and NHIF deductions.
